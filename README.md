## Details of SFMT algorithm

This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3 (SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne
Twister(SFMT)) by Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and Makoto Matsumoto
(Hiroshima University). See
<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html> for the further details.

Note well: only (2^19937 - 1) period is supported.

## Available modules

* module `sfmt`: SFMT with C NIFs
* module `sfmt_pure`: SFMT with pure Erlang
* See [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-erlang/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the detail of miscellaneous changes

## C NIFs

* Compiler requirement: C99 support (modern Clang and gcc will do): `<inttypes.h>` required
* See `c_src/sfmt_nif.c` for the details
* Also refer to sfmt-extstate at <http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate>
* The version number of this NIF is 101 (see `NIF_LOAD_INFO` macro value)

## Tested platforms

* FreeBSD/amd64 10.2-STABLE with Erlang/OTP 18.2.1
* OS X 10.11.2 El Capitanwith Erlang/OTP 18.2.

## Make options (of erlang.mk)

* `Makefile` works on both BSD/GNU make
* `Makefile.sfmt` is the real GNU make file; edit this file for modification
* Building: `make`
* C NIF Documentation: `make c_doc` (requires Doxygen 1.8.3.1 or later)
* Erlang Documentation: `make docs`
* Testing: `make tests`
* Execution speed benchmark: `make speed`
* See also [erlang.mk](https://github.com/extend/erlang.mk) for the details

## hex.pm support

* NIF building errors fixed (0.12.7 and later)
* Package name: `sfmt`
* See `mix.exs`
* Note: all builds including C and Erlang source compilation are done with `make` with `erlang.mk`

## API compatible with the random module

    seed0, seed/0, seed/3, uniform/0, uniform/1, uniform_s/1, uniform_s/3 

## TODO

* No more new feature; more load testing needed
* More documentation
* Code upgrading/reloading behavior check
