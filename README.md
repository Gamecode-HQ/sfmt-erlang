This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3 (SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne
Twister(SFMT)) by Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and Makoto
Matsumoto (Hiroshima University)

## Details of SFMT algorithm

See <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html>

* new module sfmt607 and sfmt216091 added (from 0.5.1\_RELEASE)
* new module sfmt4253 added (from 0.5.3\_RELEASE)
* new module sfmt86243 added (from 0.6.1\_BETA)
* Pure SFMT module now added as working code by request (from 0.8.0\_RELEASE)

## Seeding algorithm changed for `seed(integer())` functions

* The old `seed/1` function called `init_gen_rand/1` (up to 0.8.0\_RELEASE)
* The internal state generated by `init_gen_rand/1` is predictable,
  especially when the value of the 1st element of the state list is
  very close to the given seed value. 
  (Michael Gebetsroither discovered this behavior)
* The new `seed/1` function calls `init_by_list32/1` (from 0.8.1\_RELEASE)
  and the seed is given as `[integer()]`,
  to reduce predictability of the 1st element of the state list.

## Supported SFMT PRNG periods

* sfmt607: (2^607 - 1)
* sfmt4253: (2^4253 - 1)
* sfmt: (2^19937 - 1) (also on sfmt\_pure)
* sfmt86243: (2^86243 - 1)
* sfmt216091: (2^216091 - 1)

## C NIFs based on SFMT 1.3.3 added (from 0.3.0\_RELEASE)

* See `c_src/sfmt_nif.c` for the details
* Also refer to sfmt-extstate at <http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate>
* The version number of this NIF is 101 (see `NIF_LOAD_INFO` macro value)

## Wichmann-Hill 2006 algorithm code also included (from 0.6.0\_RELEASE)

* See `src/random_wh06.erl` for the details
* Reference for the algorithm:

    B. A. Wichmann and I. D. Hill,
    "Generating good pseudo-random numbers",
    Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 51 (2006) 1614-1622.    

* See `src/random_wh06_int.erl` for a bigint version (by Michael Truog)

    Note: this bigint version is not tested yet (no eunit test case)

## Simple test of 512x512 pixmap included (from 0.6.2\_RELEASE)

* see the files under `reference_texts/pbm_512_512/` for the details

## Notable bugfixes

* `gen_rand_all/1` is now properly applied in `sfmt_pure` module when `gen_rand32/1` was first invoked (from 0.8.2\_RELEASE)
* Catched up with the latest rebar configuration file (from 0.7.0\_RELEASE)
* Dynamically building ebin/sfmt.app (from 0.7.0\_RELEASE)
* PDIC\_SEED now named differently for each period (bugfix, from 0.5.2\_RELEASE)

## Tested platforms

* FreeBSD/amd64 10-STABLE with Erlang/OTP R15B03-1 and R16B02
* OS X 10.9 Mavericks with Erlang/OTP R15B03-1 and R16B02

### Past tested platforms

* FreeBSD/amd64 9-STABLE with Erlang/OTP R16B02
* FreeBSD/i386 8-STABLE with Erlang/OTP R15B03
* Ubuntu Linux x86\_64 12.10 with Erlang/OTP R16B

## Building 

* Use GNU/BSD make and then

    make compile

The build script is Basho's rebar at <https://github.com/basho/rebar>,
which will be automatically fetched under the directory `support/`.

## Documentation

* For the HTML documentation files of the Erlang source 

    make doc

    The documentation will be accessible at `doc/index.html`.

* For the HTML documentation files of the C NIF source (Note: Doxygen required)

    make c_doc

    The documentation will be accessible at `c_doc/index.html`.

## Testing

* For unit testing with EUnit, do

    make eunit

* For testing the speed of 100 times of invoking 100000 `gen_rand32/1` function, do 

    make speed

    (Previously this was 1000 times x 100000 invocations, but that was practically too slow.)

## API compatible with the random module

    seed0, seed/0, seed/3, uniform/0, uniform/1, uniform_s/1, uniform_s/3 

## TODO

* No more new feature; more load testing needed
* More documentation
* Code upgrading/reloading behavior check

## Notes on refactoring

* Speedup by NIF: ~40 times faster than the pure Erlang code
  (when fully inline-optimized (see rebar.config))
* For the pure-Erlang code: writing `++` (append) operators by ring buffer loops
  (as a pair of lists consuming the head elements, and the corresponding accumulators)
  made the code ~50% faster; the pure Erlang code available under `reference_texts/`
* `gen_rand32/1`, `gen_rand32_max/2`, and `gen_rand_float/1` use Erlang lists 
  (Dan Gudmudsson showed the list version is faster)
* SSE2 code and options in sfmt-extstate were removed due to causing crash of Erlang BEAM
  (and even if the SSE2 code was enabled the performance increase would be minimal)
