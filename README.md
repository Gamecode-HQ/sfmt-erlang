This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3 (SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne
Twister(SFMT)) by Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and Makoto
Matsumoto (Hiroshima University)

# Details of SFMT algorithm

See <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html>

# C NIFs based on SFMT 1.3.3 added from 0.3.0_RELEASE

* reference: sfmt-extstate at <http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate>
* see `c_src/sfmt_nif.[ch]` for the details
* speedup: ~40 times faster than the pure Erlang code (when fully inline-optimized (see rebar.config))
* Pure Erlang code available under `reference_texts/`
* `gen_rand32/1` and `gen_rand_float/1` use Erlang lists (Dan Gudmudsson showed the list version is faster)

# Tested platforms

* FreeBSD/i386 7.3-RELEASE with Erlang/OTP R14A
* RedHat Enterprise Linux AS V4 of x86_64 with Erlang/OTP R14A compiled by gcc 3.4.6 
  (on the Thin Cluster of the Kyoto University ACCMS Supercomputer System)

# Building 

* Use GNU make and then

    make compile

(Note: on FreeBSD, GNU make should be invoked as `gmake`.)

The build script is Basho's rebar at <http://hg.basho.com/rebar/> 
(which requires Erlang/OTP to run)

# API compatible with the random module

    seed0, seed/0, seed/3, uniform/0, uniform/1, uniform_s/1, uniform_s/3 

# Refactoring note of the pure-Erlang code

* Rewriting `++` (append) operators by ring buffer loops
(as a pair of lists consuming the head elements, and the corresponding accumulators)
made the code ~50% faster

# TODO

* Documentation
* NIF reload/upgrade/upload code fix; not yet fully tested
