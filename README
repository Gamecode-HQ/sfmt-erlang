This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3
(SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister(SFMT))
by 
Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and
Makoto Matsumoto (Hiroshima University)

* Details of SFMT algorithm is accessible on the Web from:
  http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html

* C NIFs based on SFMT 1.3.3 added
  * reference: sfmt-extstate at
    http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate
  * see c_src/sfmt_nif.[ch] for the details
  * speedup: ~40 times faster than the pure Erlang code
    (Note: fully inline-optimized (see rebar.config))
  * Pure Erlang code available under reference_texts/

* Tested on FreeBSD/i386 7.3-RELEASE with Erlang/OTP R14A.

* The build script is based on Basho's rebar at
  http://hg.basho.com/rebar/

* API functions compatible as the random module added

* Refactoring note of the pure-Erlang code:
  ++ (append) operators rewritten by ring buffer loops
  (lists consuming the head elements, and
   the corresponding accumulators)
  This modification made the code ~50% faster

* TODO

  * Documentation
  * NIF reload/upgrade/upload code fix;
    not yet fully tested

* THANKS to:

  * Dave "dizzyd" Smith and the Basho team, for rebar
  * Tim Bates, for random_mt.erl implementation of Mersenne Twister
